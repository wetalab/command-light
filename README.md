## Motivation

As internet products continue to satisfy user needs, their information architecture and features become increasingly complex. This complexity can make it difficult for new users to navigate the interface and settings. At the same time, experienced users desire faster ways to access functions without repeated clicking.

Inspired by Linear and macOS, the command line and spotlight interaction method seems to offer a solution to streamline user interaction without changing the product's information architecture or page interaction.

With this motivation in mind, we have developed Commandot, in the hope that it can assist many products in providing a more efficient and user-friendly experience.

## Design 

Developers can easily integrate Command Hunt into their codebase via npm/yarn. They can customize the style of Commandot and utilize the provided APIs to create their desired functionality. Additionally, Commandot will support Chat GPT, allowing for seamless integration and various types of interactions through simple configuration.
